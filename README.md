## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a London-born, Tampa-based full-stack developer driven by curiosityâ€”exploring everything from the physics of the universe to the code that brings ideas to life. Iâ€™m passionate about minimalist, clean design.

## About Me
- **Curious Mind:** I thrive on exploring new technologies, frameworks, and stacksâ€”always pushing myself to test out and integrate fresh tools.
- **Creative Interests:** Music, film, art, design, and engineering fascinate me just as much as programming. 
- **Analytical Approach:** With a strong mathematical background and a growing interest in AI/ML, Iâ€™m drawn to challenges that balance logic, aesthetics, and versatility.

## Current Focus
- ðŸ”­ **What Iâ€™m Working On:** Expanding my breadth as a full-stack developer.  
  - **Java:** Exploring Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, and robust testing practices to ensure scalable, maintainable back-end services.  
  - **Python:** Delving into frameworks like Django and Flask, implementing data-driven applications, and leveraging Pythonâ€™s rich ecosystem for quick prototyping.  
  - **Full-Stack Development:** Honing fullstack cross-plat skills, and learning DevOps best practices to build end-to-end, production-ready apps.

- ðŸ‘¯ **Looking to Collaborate:** On fun open-source initiatives and cool community projects! 

- ðŸ¤” **Seeking Mentorship & Guidance:**  
  Not just technical deep dives, but also career mentorshipâ€”insights on developing as a developer, architectural decision-making, scaling applications, team leadership, and best practices in software craftsmanship.

- âš¡ **Fun fact:** When not coding, Iâ€™m probably studying for university, reading, hanging out with friends, reading... or watching British comedy (American TV sucks!) 

## Future Goals
- **Career & Skill Growth:** As a recent graduate of the CodeBoxx Academy Full-Stack Development program, Iâ€™m applying foundational principles to continuously refine my code, learn new libraries, and deepen my understanding of system & applictaion design
- **AI/ML Aspirations:** While Iâ€™m intrigued by machine learning frameworks and data-driven solutions, Iâ€™m equally focused on improving at all levels of the stackâ€”front-end, back-end, DevOpsâ€”to become a versatile engineer.
- **Excited to kickstart my career in tech!**

## Work & Projects
Iâ€™ll be updating this space with:
- **Java Projects:** APIs, microservices, and tools that leverage Spring Boot, JUnit, and proven design patterns to ensure reliability and scalability.
- **Python Explorations:** Data-oriented applications, quick prototypes, and maybe a few ML experimentsâ€”always focusing on clean code, good structure, and real-world applicability.
- **Full-Stack Demos:** Showcasing my growth with front-end frameworks, responsive UIs, Dockerized deployments, and automated testing pipelines.


**Stay tunedâ€”thereâ€™s always more on the way!**
